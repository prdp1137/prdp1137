# Hi there! 👋

## I am Pradip Bhattarai

### About Me

Security Researcher with a strong foundation in secure coding practices and hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing across web, network, and mobile platforms. Formerly at Cryptogen Nepal, where I worked on both offensive and defensive security initiatives—ranging from infrastructure hardening and reconnaissance to cryptographic protocol analysis and system administration.

🏴 Currently hunting vulnerabilities, writing code, and simulating chaos

### 🧪 Ongoing Obsessions
- Secure coding practices  
- Breaking cryptographic implementations  
- Automating recon because laziness is efficient

Contributions and collaborations welcome—as long as you’re not a compliance consultant.
